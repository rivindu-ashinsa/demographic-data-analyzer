# demographic-data-analyzer

This project is part of the **Data Analysis with Python** course from FreeCodeCamp. The goal is to analyze demographic and employment data using Python and libraries like **Pandas**.

## Project Description
The dataset used in this project contains information about individuals' demographics and employment status. The analysis focuses on answering various questions about the data, such as:

- The proportion of individuals with advanced education earning more than $50K.
- The distribution of working hours for different demographics.
- The percentage of people earning above $50K based on race and gender.
- The country with the highest percentage of high-income individuals.
- The most common occupations among high-income individuals.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
  - Handling missing data.
  - Converting categorical data into appropriate formats.

- **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Aggregating data to calculate proportions and averages.
  - Generating insights about income levels based on demographic factors.

- **Visualization:**
  - Creating visual representations of demographic distributions (if applicable).

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
